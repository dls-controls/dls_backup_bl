How to Use
----------

All examples here use the beamline i16. Substitute i16 with the beamline name you 
are working with.

Run these tools on a beamline workstation or provide the 
beamline name with the command line parameter ``--beamline i16``.

First create a configuration file that describes the devices on the 
beamline. The following command will allow you to view and edit the
list of devices that the backup process will manage::

    dls-backup-gui

This will open a GUI that will allow you to configure the devices.

Once the configuration is complete you can launch the full backup with::

    dls_backup_bl

Note that you can backup a subset of devices like this::

    dls_backup_bl --devices BL16I-MO-STEP-01 BL16I-MO-STEP-02

More Help
---------

Both tools have help which describes the command line options::

    dls-backup-gui --help
    dls_backup_bl --help

Backup Files
------------

All the backup files are stored in ``/dls_sw/work/motion/Backups/BL16I``

The device description file is 
``/dls_sw/work/motion/Backups/BL16I/BL16I-backup.json``

There are also log files in this directory. Plus a subfolder for each class
of backup device.

The backup folder is a git 
repository and all backups are incremental only. The full history of 
backups can be retrieved with git commands.
